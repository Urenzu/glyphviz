glyphviz
--------

Prototype for a square canvas that animates procedural noise, quantizes it into bands, and maps those into a glyph grid.

Setup
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to start the Vite dev server (open the printed URL).
- `npm run build` for a production build, `npm run preview` to serve it locally.

Tuning
- Set `startPresetName` in `src/main.ts` to any preset name from `src/presets.ts` or to `"custom"` and edit `customConfig` inline.
- Live stats/preset name show in the HUD; press `p` while running to cycle presets.
- Core field params live in `src/main.ts` (`bandCount`, `scale`, `drift`, glyph set, palette).
- Canvas sizing is square and responsive; tweak `config.cols`/`rows` for denser or more open layouts.
