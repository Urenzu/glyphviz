Square frame for video-based / moving / real time procedural noise fields -> quantized bands -> glyph maps

I want to learn about noise generation, smoothing / blurring, quantization / clustering, mapping levels -> symbols. Etc.

My goal is to learn whilst developing a tool that can do interesting life-like sci-fi glyph visualizations. I want to capture a certain aesthetic which is used in the game Marathon (By Bungie).
